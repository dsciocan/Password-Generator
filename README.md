# Password Generator


## Description

Web page that helps the user generate a secure password at the click of a button.

Input is taken from the user on the password length they need (between 8 and 128 characters), then on the character types they would like the generated password to contain. 

Note: the password must contain at least one of the four character types:
 * Lowercase
 * Uppercase
 * Numeric
 * Special characters

Then, based on user input, the password is displayed in the dedicated field.
